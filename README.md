lab02 - Implementation of a ring data structure.

lab03 - Implementation of a vector data structure.

lab04 - Linked List implementation.

lab05 - Program to convert a base 10 number to any base 2-36.

lab06 - Implement a stack using the vector in the standard library.

lab07 - Implement a queue using the list in the standard library.

lab08 - The purpose of this program is to read an infix epression from the command line and convert it to a postfix epression.
        The program then takes the postfix expression and evaluates it.
